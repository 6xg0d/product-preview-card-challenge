## My process

This was my first time using media queries, so this challenge took me a couple hours more than the previous ones where the design doesn't change much. I can't say i haven't fun tho! At the beginning it was a little bit complicate to me understand how to use queries, but after reading again the Intro of the Path and looking the example i was able to understand enough to solve this challenge. I'm looking forward to learn even more about responsive design! :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a little bit more about SVG when i had to place the icon, a basic understanding about media queries, and the possibility to practice my flexbox skills even more. Also first time using "em" instead of pixel, still getting use to it.

### Continued development

I'm happy with the final result, i think looks pretty close to the design. Spacing it's still a little bit problematic, i know the space between the text and the card isn't exactly the same from the design, but still happy that i completed the challenge with a decent outcome. So if i have to improve something about this design in the future, would be that. 

### Useful resources

- [em calculator](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-em-converter) - This helped me to save time using em instead of pixels.
- [CSS text decoration property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_decoration.asp) - This is an article from W3SCHOOLS which helped me to remember the values of the text decoration property, in this case: line-through.
